<p>Lines 8 and 9 were added to make sure the program returns the definition of words that start with a capital letter (e.g. Delhi or Texas):</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import json

</pre><p>You can read the comments I&nbsp;included in the code: I have&nbsp;added another conditional in lines 8 and 9. The <code>w.title()</code> method will convert the first letter to uppercase and the rest&nbsp;to lowercase. If the program didn't find anything for "texas" in the first conditional in lines 6 and 7, then this conditional will try to search for "Texas". Even if the user entered "TEXAS" this conditional will convert it to "Texas".</p>
